                <p>I am a computer science student at Everett Community College. Currently I am studying Java, but I am also 
                learning web development(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to expand my knowledgeMy goal is to be a software engineer. 
                I am also taking online courses such as this 2023 Web Development Bootcamp to expand my knowledge. I have found a 
                passion for programming ever since I started my first computer science class. Just the thought of being able to
                make full fledged applications and websites one day makes me want to learn more and more.</p></td>
